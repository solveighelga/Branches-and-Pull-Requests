# Branches-and-Pull-Requests

S贸lveig was the Mother and created the repository.

Elsa used fork to clone the code into her own repository and made changes to the code, html and css.

Elsa created pull request and S贸lveig accepted the changes and merged the files.

Elsa, Victoria and Sigurborg used git clone to get S贸lveigs repository.

When we added the new branch we did it from VS Code. There we added a new branch and saw it in the left bottom corner.

First we merged with the new branch and then we made a second branch and pushed the origin so that the mother (S贸lveig) accepted the changes in github, went to the second branch in VS code, wrote git pull in terminal, switched over to main and then merged the main and branch together.
